To Yao in 3 years:

How are you doing? where are you in PhD, in life, and on earth? How is your blog? 
 
I am from 2016. Just started PhD officially this month. I feel a lot of pressure. I need to learn, I want to learn. The only thing is that I need to build better habits and be focused on the things I should do. It sounds easy, as it should be. I plan to learn German and be fluent in 6-8 month. And write a blog. And practise programming in python, c++, and for IOS sytem.   

I hope you are doing well, as I imagined, confident, smart, beautiful, published 4 papers, attended 5-7 times conference, about to finish PhD study, great at research and work, ready to go to another continent for a new start, have some fame in the field, have a bright futhure. 

I am here to use all the tools, to know intersting things, to understander how the world works, to be inspired and inspire others, to be a useful individual. Be curious Be active. Enjoy knowledge Enjoy life. Can't wait to see me in 3 years.
